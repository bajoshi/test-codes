To generate an annotated file that shows the C code generated by Cython for your Python code you should do --

>> cython -a name_of_file.pyx

This will generate a HTML file which you can open in the browser. 
Yellow lines show where a Python interaction happens. The fewer yellow lines you see the better. No yellow lines means that your code was able to be compiled completely in C.
